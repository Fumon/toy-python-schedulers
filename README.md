# Toy Python Schedulers

A friend had an operating systems assignment which inspired me to learn some new Python syntax. This lead to overuse of the new-to-me structural pattern matching, Enum, and a few other features which made the code a little roundabout. This was not coded for performance in any way.

Along with an overwrought simulator and `Process` implementation which does most of the work, the project includes implementations for:

- First Come First Serve
- Round Robin
- Shortest Job First
